abstract = {Agile software development represents a major departure from traditional, plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations.}

abstract = {Most agile methods divide a project into sprints (iterations), and include a sprint planning phase that is critical to ensure the project success. Several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, which makes the planning problem difficult. In this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that, given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, produces a multi-sprint optimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. To cope with the inherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects, our approach ensures that a baseline plan can be revised and re-optimized during project execution without disrupting it, which we call smooth replanning. The planning problem is converted into a generalized assignment problem, given a linear programming formulation, and solved using the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer. Our model is validated on both real and synthetic projects. In particular, a case study on two real projects confirms the effectiveness of our approach; as to efficiency, for medium-sized problems an exact solution is found in a few minutes, while for large problems a heuristic solution that is less than 1% far from the exact one is returned in a few seconds. Finally, some smooth replanning tests investigate the trade-off between plan quality and stability.}

abstract = {Agile methods for software development promote iterative design and implementation. Most of them divide a project into functionalities, called user stories; at each iteration, often called a sprint, a subset of user stories are developed. The sprint planning phase is critical to ensure the project success, but it is also a difficult problem because several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, e.g., the estimated complexity, business value, and affinity of the user stories to be included in each sprint. In this paper we present an approach for sprint planning based on an integer linear programming model. Given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, the optimal solution of the model is a sprint plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. Solving to optimality the model by a general-purpose MIP solver, such as IBM Ilog Cplex, takes time and for some instances even finding a feasible solution requires too large computing times for an operational use. For this reason we propose an effective Lagrangian heuristic based on a relaxation of the proposed model and some greedy and exchange algorithms. Computational results on both real and synthetic projects show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

SCRUM defines the systems development process as a loose set of activities that combines known, workable tools and techniques with the best that a development team can devise to build systems. Since these activities are loose, controls to manage the process and inherent risk are used. SCRUM is an enhancement of the commonly used iterative/incremental object-oriented development cycle.",

These papers have primarily emphasized modeling and algorithmic contributions for specific classes of project scheduling problems, such as net present value (NPV) maximization and makespan minimization, with and without resource constraints. Paralleling these developments has been the research in the area of project scheduling decision support, with its emphasis on data sets, data generation methods, and so on, that are essential to benchmark, evaluate, and compare the new models, algorithms and heuristic techniques. These investigations have extended the frontiers of research and application in all areas of project scheduling and management. In this paper, we survey the vast literature in this area with a perspective that integrates models, data, and optimal and heuristic algorithms, for the major classes of project scheduling problems. We also include recent surveys that have compared commercial project scheduling systems. Finally, we present an overview of web-based decision support systems and discuss the potential of this technology in enabling and facilitating researchers and practitioners in identifying new areas of inquiry and application.}

Therefore, a new concept of portfolio management that is based on delegation and communication is required in the multiproject organization. The paper demonstrates how portfolio management can be put into practice by applying the planning and control cycle of individual projects to trade off the interests of project leaders and department heads in a team effort. By coupling the planning and control cycles for single projects and the portfolio of projects, an overall framework is built to meet the multiproject challenge. In this framework, the project-breakdown structure and organization-breakdown structure are linked. The paper concludes with the description of a practical application of the framework and the required supporting information system.}

abstract = {Project scheduling is concerned with single-item or small batch production where scarce resources have to be allocated to dependent activities over time. Applications can be found in diverse industries such as construction engineering, software development, etc. Also, project scheduling is increasingly important for make-to-order companies where the capacities have been cut down in order to meet lean management concepts. Likewise, project scheduling is very attractive for researchers, because the models in this area are rich and, hence, difficult to solve. For instance, the resource-constrained project scheduling problem contains the job shop scheduling problem as a special case. So far, no classification scheme exists which is compatible with what is commonly accepted in machine scheduling. Also, a variety of symbols are used by project scheduling researchers in order to denote one and the same subject. Hence, there is a gap between machine scheduling on the one hand and project scheduling on the other with respect to both, viz. a common notation and a classification scheme. As a matter of fact, in project scheduling, an ever growing number of papers is going to be published and it becomes more and more difficult for the scientific community to keep track of what is really new and relevant. One purpose of our paper is to close this gap. That is, we provide a classification scheme, i.e. a description of the resource environment, the activity characteristics, and the objective function, respectively, which is compatible with machine scheduling and which allows to classify the most important models dealt with so far. Also, we propose a unifying notation. The second purpose of this paper is to review some of the recent developments. More specifically, we review exact and heuristic algorithms for the single-mode and the multi-mode case, for the time–cost tradeoff problem, for problems with minimum and maximum time lags, for problems with other objectives than makespan minimization and, last but not least, for problems with stochastic activity durations.}

abstract = {Context
Release scheduling deals with the selection and assignment of deliverable features to a sequence of consecutive product deliveries while several constraints are fulfilled. Although agile software development represents a major approach to software engineering, there is no well-established conceptual definition and sound methodological support of agile release scheduling.
Objective
To propose a solution, we present, (1) a conceptual model for agile scheduling, and (2) a novel multiple knapsack-based optimization model with (3) a branch-and-bound optimization algorithm for agile release scheduling.
Method
To evaluate our model simulations were carried out seven real life and several generated data sets.
Results
The developed algorithm strives to prevent resource overload and resource underload, and mitigates risks of delivery slippage.
Conclusion
The results of the experiment suggest that this approach can provide optimized semi-automatic release schedule generations and more informed and established decisions utilizing what-if-analysis on the fly to tailor the best schedule for the specific project context.}

Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the most popular agile software development methodologies. XP is defined as a consistent set of values and practices designed to work well together, but lacks practices for project management and especially for supporting the customer role. The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan.
Objective
To assist release planning in XP by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan.
Method
We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation.
Results
Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in practice.
Conclusion
An optimization model can be used in practice to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions faster. This can help adopting XP in projects where plan-driven approaches have traditionally been used.}

abstract = {To achieve higher flexibility and to better satisfy actual customer requirements, there is an increasing tendency to develop and deliver software in an incremental fashion. In adopting this process, requirements are delivered in releases and so a decision has to be made on which requirements should be delivered in which release. Three main considerations that need to be taken account of are the technical precedences inherent in the requirements, the typically conflicting priorities as determined by the representative stakeholders, as well as the balance between required and available effort. The technical precedence constraints relate to situations where one requirement cannot be implemented until another is completed or where one requirement is implemented in the same increment as another one. Stakeholder preferences may be based on the perceived value or urgency of delivered requirements to the different stakeholders involved. The technical priorities and individual stakeholder priorities may be in conflict and difficult to reconcile. This paper provides (i) a method for optimally allocating requirements to increments; (ii) a means of assessing and optimizing the degree to which the ordering conflicts with stakeholder priorities within technical precedence constraints; (iii) a means of balancing required and available resources for all increments; and (iv) an overall method called EVOLVE aimed at the continuous planning of incremental software development. The optimization method used is iterative and essentially based on a genetic algorithm. A set of the most promising candidate solutions is generated to support the final decision. The paper evaluates the proposed approach using a sample project.}

abstract = {The release planning (RP) problem can be investigated from two dimensions -- what to release and when to release. We investigate the "what" to release decision in terms of which new features or change requests should be assigned and implemented in which releases of a software system. RP for evolving systems is challenging, because the new features might require changes to the existing system. A major drawback of existing RP methods is that, they do not consider the existing systems in making RP decisions. In this paper, we present a technique to detect coupling between features based on relatedness of the components that would implement the features. The components implementing the features are derived from change impact analysis. We integrate the results from feature coupling into a RP strategy that encourages the assignment of highly coupled features in the same release. This helps to avoid haphazard implementation of related features. We present a decision support approach that formulates the RP problem as a bi-objective optimization problem. Our Bi-Objective Release Planning for Evolving Systems (BORPES) is aimed at optimizing the value of release plans from both the business perspectives and the implementation perspectives. This paper presents BORPES in detail and reports on a proof-of-concept case study that investigates the applicability of the proposed approach. The bi-objective optimization offers a set of Pareto-optimal solutions.},

    abstract = { Critical chain scheduling/Buffer management (CCS/BM)—the direct application of the theory of constraints (TOC) to project management—has received much attention in project management literature. There still is controversy over the merits and pitfalls of the CCS/BM methodology. This paper focuses on the fundamental elements of CCS/BM logic and pinpoints some intricacies that are not commonly referred to in the available literature. The authors’ analysis is based on a critical review of the relevant sources and experimentation with both commercial CCS/BM software and an internally developed CCS/BM-based tool. }

abstract = {In this study, we address a rescheduling problem in parallel machine environments under machine eligibility constraints. We consider total flow time as efficiency measure and the number of jobs processed on different machines in the initial and revised schedules as a stability measure. We present an optimizing algorithm for minimizing the stability measure subject to the constraint that the efficiency measure is at its minimum level. We then propose several heuristic procedures to generate a set of approximate efficient schedules relative to efficiency and stability measures.}
